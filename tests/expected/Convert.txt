Demonstration of DOCX support in 
calibre
This document demonstrates the ability of the calibre DOCX Input plugin to convert 
the various typographic features in a Microsoft Word (2007 and newer) document. 
Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB 
for other ebook readers, to see it in action.
There is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and 
various types of text and paragraph level formatting.
To see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the “Add
Books” button and then click “Convert”.  Set the output format in the top right corner of
the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click “OK”.
Text Formatting
Inline formatting
Here, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of 
embedded fonts.
Here is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out  text. Then, we have
a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a 
yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.
A paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense 
emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text 
properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with 
equal ease.
Fun with fonts
This document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the 
Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every 
letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be 
embedded in the output ebook during conversion. 
Paragraph level formatting
You can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this
paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray
background.
For the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often 
come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry 
retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to 
display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it 
is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.
Tables
Tables in Word can vary from the extremely simple
to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best 
when converting tables. While you may run into trouble
with the occasional table, the vast majority of common 
cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated 
in this section. Note that for optimum results, when 
creating tables in Word, you should set their widths 
using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating 
two column table with a nice green border and header row.
Now let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial 
borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.
City or 
Town
Point A Point B Point C Point D Point E
Point A —
Point B 87 —
Point C 64 56 —
Point D 37 32 91 —
Point E 93 35 54 43 —
Next, we see a table with special formatting in various locations. Notice how the 
formatting for the header row and sub header rows is preserved.

Next, we have something a little more complex, a nested table, i.e. a table inside 
another table. Additionally, the inner table has some of its cells merged. The table is 
displayed horizontally centered.

To the left is a table inside

We end with a fancy calendar, note how much of the original formatting is 
preserved. Note that this table will only display correctly on relatively wide screens. In 
general, very wide tables or tables whose cells have fixed width requirements don’t fare 
well in ebooks.

Structural Elements
Miscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, 
endnotes, dropcaps and the like. 
Footnotes & Endnotes
Footnotes1 and endnotesi are automatically recognized and both are converted to 
endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.
Dropcaps
rop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a 
section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap 
should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible 
when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line 
height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the 
result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of 
text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the 
device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.
D
Links
Two kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those 
that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For 
example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that 
points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.
Table of Contents
There are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. 
The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table 
of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of 
Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level 
Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.
If no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is 
automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as 
something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings 
are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 
the second level and so on.
 You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of 
Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. 
1 In paged media, footnotes are usually displayed at the bottom of the text. 
However, in ebooks, a better paradigm is to make them clickable endnotes that the user
can browse at her pleasure. This conversion is handled automatically by calibre.

Images
Images can be of three main types. Inline images
are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this
image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause
breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating 
image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more 
types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the 
conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the 
left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.
The final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own
and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.
Centered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of 
attention. 
Generally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word 
document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in 
absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, 
so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close 
to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the 
page in Word.
Lists
All types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use
fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.
Bulleted List
 One
 Two
Numbered List
1. One, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list 
is working correctly
2. Two
Multi-level Lists
1. One
1.1.Two
1.1.1. Three
1.1.2. Four with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for
the list is working correctly.
1.1.3. Five
2. Six
A Multi-level list with bullets:
 One
 Two
This bullet uses an image as the bullet item
o Four
 Five
Continued Lists
i. One
ii. Two
An interruption in our regularly scheduled listing, for this essential and very relevant 
public service announcement.
iii. We now resume our normal programming
iv. Four
i Endnotes are typically used for longer notes, they remain endnotes when converted into 
ebook form, except that they have an additional backlink to make it easy to return to the 
current position after reading the note.
